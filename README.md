The enhanced Python-based typing speed tester application introduces several new features to improve user experience and functionality. The graphical user interface, built with Tkinter, offers a colorful and engaging design with an intuitive layout. Users can select text difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) and start a typing test, which measures their words per minute (WPM) and accuracy. New features include a leaderboard to track and display high scores, allowing users to see their progress and compete with others. The application also offers pause and resume functionality, enabling users to temporarily stop the test and resume later without losing progress. Sound effects can be added for key presses and completion for an interactive experience. The tester provides real-time feedback, highlights errors, and offers detailed performance metrics. Users can switch between light and dark modes for better visual comfort. The application is lightweight, cross-platform, and customizable, making it a versatile tool for improving typing skills.
