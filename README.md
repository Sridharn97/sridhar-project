This project presents a Typing Speed Test application using Python with tkinter for the GUI and pynput for keyboard input monitoring. Users can select a test duration (1, 2, or 3 minutes) and type a displayed paragraph as quickly and accurately as possible. The application calculates and displays performance metrics, including time taken, words per minute (WPM), and typing accuracy, providing an engaging way to assess and improve typing skills.

The interface consists of a text display area for the paragraph to be typed, an    entry field for user input, and selectable options for the test duration. The user can choose between different durations (1, 2, or 3 minutes), with corresponding paragraphs loaded from pre-specified files. The test begins automatically when the user starts typing and concludes either when the time elapses or when the user completes typing the paragraph.
